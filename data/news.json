Attention thins, emotions accelerate, adults prove no more resilient than teenagers, autonomy erodes in micro-increments, and identity becomes whatever narrative the algorithm reflects back. No machines, no pods, no cables — just a device we willingly consult. The dreamworld didn’t need to trap us. We walked in, thumb first, without noticing the door.",
