At some corporate houses, usually one day in advance, the marbled aisle between banks of cubicles would sport the boiling rice pot and host traditional games that go link-armed with the harvest festival. For the 9to5ers, this is an act of symbolism, one designed to strengthen their bonds with teammates. Here are two corporate professionals from Chennai who decided to go in for the real McCoy — having all of these festivities in its original settings, on the earthen path with stubbles of grass separating paddy fields. For them, this is an act of gratitude, one that renews their bond with the land where they grow their own food. Treading separate paths, these two represent a growing tribe among the urbane that seeks greater purpose by pausing the bustle, if not muting it entirely",
