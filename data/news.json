    "description": "Cheney died in November 2025 at the age of 84 from complications of pneumonia and heart disease. His family called him “a noble giant of a man.” His critics might call him the architect of ruin. But everyone agrees: he reshaped the American presidency, bent the arc of global history, and never once looked back. Long before Trump normalised authoritarian instincts in public, Cheney operationalised them in secret without even bothering to tweet about it. Cheney might have found redemption among Never-Trumper liberals, but for those who have to live in the world, Darth Vader has no redemption — only the haunting echo of the Imperial March.",
