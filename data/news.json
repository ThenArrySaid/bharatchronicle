    "description": "Alcohol has long been a part of social and cultural life, but the question of how much is truly safe remains complex. Science shows that alcohol has a biphasic effect — small amounts may offer some cardiovascular benefits, while higher intakes, even occasional, can harm the heart, liver, brain, and overall health. Individual factors like genetics, sex, and metabolism influence how the body processes alcohol, making “safe” levels vary from person to person.",
