Smith strongly criticized Donald Trump for his \"irresponsible\" remarks following Charlie Kirk's murder, specifically Trump's quick blame of \"the Left.\" Smith argued Trump's polarizing comments deepened national division and fear instead of uniting people after the tragic September 10, 2025, incident. This sparked wider debate on political speech.",
