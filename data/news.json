He said he had met foreign ministers, diplomats and scholars around the world who read the newsletter daily, and argued that the newspaper could have tried monetising that reach instead of abolishing it.",

From the ₹20,000 crore Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) mission to the massive scaling up of rooftop solar under PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, the Budget signals ambitious intent but also cautious execution.\n\nWe analyse spending on decentralised solar, grid-scale solar and land conflicts, PM-KUSUM for agriculture, nuclear energy push, green hydrogen challenges, and adaptation funding. The episode explores the gap between announcements and real-world outcomes, and what it means for India’s path to a low-carbon future.",
