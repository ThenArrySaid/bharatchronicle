While opening up about the iconic chemistry in the landmark sitcom ‘Sarabhai VS Sarabhai’, she feels agitated about the underutilised talent of late actor Satish Shah.\n\n“None of the directors at that time had the eyes to see Satish Shah’s talent. They were as bad as the commercial directors they dissed,” she says. Ratna Pathak Shah, in this exclusive interview, speaks on why good comedy is not being made in the country, and how it was a loss for the country to not see Satish Shah beyond his comical roles.\n\nPresentation: Vinaya Deshpande \nEditing: Tayyab Hussain S M\nVideo: Emmanual Yogini",
