    "description": "Tylenol, or to use its generic name paracetamol, was in the news recently when Donald Trump suddenly put on his ‘Doctor’ cap and claimed that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, was causing autism, warned pregnant women to avoid the drug, and said the USFDA would include warnings for its use — much to the chagrin of scientific consensus. The problem, however, is that Americans no longer ‘trust the science’. Much like with the Democrats, Americans have had a very messy break-up with scientific consensus — and some of it is thanks to “Dr” Trump, but also because of the mendacious propaganda that passed itself off as science.",
