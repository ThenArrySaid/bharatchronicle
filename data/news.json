His presidency mainstreamed cultural victories but torched bipartisanship, replacing incremental change with identity politics and leaving conservatives convinced their America had been stolen. Donald Trump was not an aberration but the sequel: he exaggerated Obama’s template, weaponising resentment, chaos, and survival as legitimacy. Together, they forged a feedback loop where politics became existential theatre. Obama made history, Trump turned it into farce — and America, caught between poetry and parody, may never recover its lost consensus.",
