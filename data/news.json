She simply uploaded a carousel of her trip: serene landscapes, neon streets, sushi dinners and then, suddenly, Justin Trudeau, smiling like a man who had very intentionally chosen this era of his life. The caption, “tokyo times on tour and more”, was vague in the way bold announcements often are. The emoji selection — hearts, flowers, soft smiles — did the rest of the heavy lifting. Trudeau, for his part, had already warmed the public to the idea by sharing a photo of the two with Japan’s former prime minister and his wife. It was the sort of diplomatic cameo that would have looked routine if not for the unmistakable sense that something more was happening beyond the frame.",
