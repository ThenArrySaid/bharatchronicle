In an internal memo obtained by Business Insider, Nadella emphasized the need to rapidly transform the company's approach to AI economics, similar to its cloud computing pivot 15 years ago. The move reflects Nadella's concerns about Microsoft's survival in the AI era, as he warned employees that some of the company's biggest businesses may become irrelevant without fundamental changes.",
