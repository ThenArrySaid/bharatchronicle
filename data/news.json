The fact that many elements – including friendship, revenge, love and fights – were part of the cinematic package appealed to them. I hope they love it today too.”\n\nIn an exclusive with ‘The Hindu’, as part of ‘This Changed my Life’ podcast, the director talks about how Rajinikanth influenced an entire generation and how his films were lapped up.\n\nInterview: Srinivasa Ramanujam\nVideo: S Shiva Raj\nEdit: Johan Sathyadas",
