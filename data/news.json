    "description": "‘Jana Nayagan’ has been stuck in a long censor fight. The film was supposed to release on January 9, 2026. But the CBFC asked for cuts and then paused the process again because of some concerns about army scenes and religious points. This made the producers upset. They went to the Madras High Court asking for quick certification. The court looked into the case, but nothing moved fast. Now the producers have changed their mind. They do not want to fight in court anymore. They told the court that they want to withdraw the case. The petition is now listed “for withdrawal” on February 10, 2026. This means the legal path is ending. The CBFC revising committee can now check the film without any break. Fans are watching everything closely. Many fans are asking for updates online. Some are hopeful. Some are frustrated because the film has been delayed for a whole month. But everyone is waiting for the next big step. The next confirmed update will come only from the CBFC. The movie’s fate now depends on the revising committee’s decision.",

In that climate, Mandelson’s return has become a liability rather than an asset, raising uncomfortable questions not about guilt, but about judgement.",
