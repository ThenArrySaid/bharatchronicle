    "description": "Three major opposition yatras, including Rahul Gandhi’s Voter Adhikar Yatra, Tejashwi Yadav’s Bihar Adhikar Yatra and Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Padyatra, drew large crowds but produced no electoral gains. The BJP-led NDA won more than 202 of 243 seats, leaving the INDIA bloc weakened. Rahul’s “vote chori” message failed to resonate, Tejashwi’s tour did not expand his support, and Kishor’s long padyatra ended without a single victory, showing that spectacle cannot replace organisation in Bihar’s caste-driven politics.",
