    <!-- Inline fallback data for the dynamic news feed.
         When the page is opened directly via the file:// scheme, modern browsers
         prevent JavaScript from loading local files via fetch() due to
         cross‑origin restrictions.  To that end we embed a copy of the
         news.json file below.  The script will use this data if it
         cannot fetch from the data directory.  To update the feed, either
         serve this site via a local webserver (so fetch works) or
         replace the JSON below with fresh content generated by fetch_news.py.
